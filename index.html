          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p> Households in States with higher median incomes and lower poverty rates tend to have areas with healthier
            resources
            available, like good grocery stores, safe housing,
            opportunities to exercise, clean air, and better schools. In comparison, households in States with lower
            median incomes
            and higher poverty rates typically have less money
            to spend taking care of themselves, whether paying for visits to the doctor, medicine, or healthy food.
            Hence, these
            states appear to have relatively higher obesity and
            smoking rates. Additionally, stress associated with a lower income, especially during childhood, increases
            risk for
            heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes. </p>
          <p> Overall, the median age across the US appears to be in the 30-45 year range. Households in the 36-40 age
            range
            appear to have 26%-36% obesity rates. Interestingly, smokers
            started as early as 17.5 years based on the numbers for New Hampshire.</p>
